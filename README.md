# UFOs Analysis

## Overview of Project

For this project, we are creating a webpage that contains a dynamic table. Within this table, there is data containing information regarding sightings of UFO’s from around the country during the first two weeks of 2010. Several different search criteria exist such as date, city, state, country, and shape. The table then updates and filters only the data that matches the search criteria.

## Results

Users of this webpage will be able to search for certain data within the dynamic table. The following image is how the page looks when a user accesses it.

Notice how the left-hand side shows five different input boxes to filter the table from. The user may filter the table by date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO. The following image shows the table being filtered by all the sightings that occurred on January 3rd, 2010.

The user must match the placeholder’s format and type this date as 1/3/2010. Once the user presses “Enter”, the table automatically updates. There is only one UFO sighting in this table that occurred on this date. The following image shows what will occur if no results match the search criteria.

In this example, we searched for all UFO sightings in the table that occurred in Illinois. Since there were not any sightings, the table filtered out all the data and is blank.

## Summary

Although this webpage is fantastic and running smoothly, there is always room for improvement.

### One Drawback

One drawback of this webpage and dynamic table is that the search criteria must match the placeholder’s format in each input box. If a user were to type “California” into the state box instead of “ca”, then the table would yield no results even though there are several UFO sightings in California.

### Recommendations

One recommendation is to add the ability for the user to sort the table by the other columns. The table is automatically sorted by date, but it would be nice to alphabetically sort the columns for cities, states, or shapes. 

Another recommendation is to add an input box for “Keywords”. This will allow the user to search for key words in the “Comments” column of the table. Being able to do this can help analyze the data in the table in a better way, by sorting or counting the number of instances for a certain description of sighting.
